From Excel intuition to type-theoretic correctness: domain logic made clear, correct, and composable.

Imagine a language where domain experts can model their rules as easily as they do in Excel — using sets, 
tables, and formulas — but every rule is provably correct and type-safe. That’s our DSL: intuitive 
set-theoretic syntax on the surface, powered by type-theoretic rigor underneath.
No Rete networks, no Java boilerplate, no opaque aggregates — just clarity, 
correctness, and composability. It’s the SQL of domain logic: expressive, verifiable, 
and immediately usable by humans and machines alike.

Most business rules and domain models today are trapped in verbose, 
brittle general-purpose code — think Java with Lombok acrobatics 
or Rete-based BRMS. Meanwhile, domain experts with no programming background 
can model complex realities in Excel using nothing more than sets, tables, and formulas. 
Our DSL bridges that gap: it presents domain logic as intuitive set-theoretic and 
predicate constructs, but under the hood, it’s fully type-theoretic and provably sound.
The result? Domain experts can write, read, and reason about rules naturally, 
while developers get a robust, composable, and verifiable system. 
No aggregates, no mutable caches, no opaque engines — just clarity, correctness, 
and expressive power, all embedded seamlessly in the host language of your choice.
