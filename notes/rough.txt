BR engine on parquet, arrow, DuckDB instead of Java objects
Option for "Assert" = populating arrow 
DuckDB scan from OLTP DB
Semantics for parquet and arrow data
Data consistency checks

Generate sqlite/DDL as interface spec and for development

Analysis Patterns
Data Model Patters

Stateless immutable
Output to host - sandbox
Save to SQLite/DuckDB/Parquet - reproducible state
Complex billing, settlements
AMPL with units and more compile time constructs (type system) and data treansformation.
JRules, Drools with no RETE to mystify clear models and add unecessary overhead and 
without parachuting another language in.

Overkill for shopping cart

CLI loads model, creates SQLite, launches DB4S, reloads model on code editor changes

Aggregates, entities, values are the details of  
the machine unnecessarily leaking into your
modeling formalism.

Anemic object model? 
The most succesful ERP is Excel. 
The transaction scripts are macros, VBA and humans.
You measure accumulated calories wrongly.

As microservice
